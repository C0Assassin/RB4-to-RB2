# RB4-to-RB2

Welcome to the RB4 to RB2 repo. These files are for PS3 only, but can be converted to 360. Eventually a 360 version will be branched off of this one.

## Songs Completed (65/65):
All Rock Band 4 disc songs are playable.

TODO:
-

*  ~~Check volume issues with the songs listed in the issues list.~~
*  Make sure all songs are properly normalized/volume'd at or near the same loudness.
*  ~~Encrypt moggs so the songs can be playable in RB3.~~
*  Test all songs once more to make sure there are no issues.
*  ~~Add harmonies to a couple of songs that are missing them.~~
